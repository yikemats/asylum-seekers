# [NYC Pays Forward to Immigrants](https://yikemats.github.io/Project1/)

This repository is for my second project at [the Lede Program 2023](https://ledeprogram.com/). I scraped a Bloomberg article to gather a list of hotels where immigrants stay, converted the addresses to longitude/latitude data, and created a map using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/). Additionally, I calculated the point of offset that New York City pays for housing immigrants during the budgeted period, utilizing the [immigrants numbers](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/DHS-Daily-Report/k46n-sa2m) provided by the Office of [the New York Comptroller](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/accounting-for-asylum-seekers/).
